Improve doc simon/cleanups,
Separate and generalize robust_ecdsa with ot_based_ecdsa
Unify interface (CSCurve vs frost curve)
    This implies getting rid of the from from_secp256k1sha256_to_cscurve_vk and from_secp256k1sha256_to_cscurve_sk
Add the active adversary functionality for robust ecdsa
make sure k256 is always activated without --feature k256 build in cargo
Try adding (if possible) reducing the set of participant signers wrt set of presigners (just like in ot-based ecdsa implementation where you linearize the shares)

Unify the test cases between the different ecdsa implementations


Add the unified test to both ecdsa files



Do away with lagrange::<CSCurve> and rename generic lagrange to lagrange
